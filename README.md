# Bootstrap Portfolio.

## Description.
In this project, I worked to create my own personal Portfolio using Bootstrap. Here I used elements like the Navbar, Jumbotron and the cards.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The links in the navigation bar are clickable and will redirect the user to the section of the page they want to view.
Also hovering with the cursor on the pictures, will make them enlarge and if clicked, they will also redirect the user to my GitHub pages.
